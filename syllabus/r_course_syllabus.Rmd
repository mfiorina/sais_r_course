## Course Description

Entry-level research and analysis positions in universities, government offices and contractors, think tanks, and multilateral institutions are increasingly expected to perform basic quantitative tasks using statistical software such as Stata, R, or Python. As data work has become near-ubiquitous in the policy world, so have basic tasks like aggregating, analyzing, summarizing, and visualizing data.

This course introduces you to statistical analysis programming using the R language. R is an open-source, statistical programming language used widely across a number of industries. This course will also aim to provide you with the foundation to continue to develop your knowledge and experience of R beyond its duration.

---

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to set up their own R environment and feel comfortable using R for simple data tasks in coursework, internships, or entry-level research/data positions. They will have the foundation to continue to learn by practicing R beyond this course.

In more detail, students will be introduced to the use of:

- `dplyr`'s `select()` and `mutate()` functions to explore and modify datasets;
- `dplyr`'s `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions to generate summary statistics;
- `tidyr`'s `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions to reshape data for easier analysis;
- `purrr`'s `map()` and `dplyr`'s `across()` functions to perform iterative coding;
- The `gt` and `stargazer` packages to generate HTML, PNG, or LateX summary tables;
- The `ggplot2` package to generate descriptive scatter plots of data.

## Course Structure

Each two-hour session will be split into two halves. The first half (approx. one hour) will consist of an interactive lecture using slides and live coding. The second half (approx. one hour) will consist of practical exercises that the students will accomplish with my support.

The last two sessions will begin with multiple-choice questionnaires on the topic of the previous week's content. At the end of the course, there will be an open-ended assignment in which the students will have the option to create a script, which I will then review and provide feedback.

## Course Readings/Resources

As there will be no time for this in class, **YOU NEED TO DO THE FOLLOWING BEFORE THE FIRST SESSION:**

- Download R at this link: https://cran.r-project.org/
  - Windows users, click on 'Download R for Windows' and then download the 'base' version. The file should be called `R-4.4.1-win.exe`.
  - Mac users, click on 'Download R for MacOS' and then download the file called:
      - `R-4.4.1-arm64.pkg` if you have a more recent MacBook with an M1 chip.
      - `R-4.4.1.pkg` if you have an older MacBook with an Intel chip or run an older iOs.
  
- Download RStudio at this link: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. Download the 'RStudio Desktop: Open Source Edition' version.

Students can then download data and code templates using the following instructions:

- Open RStudio.
- Type in the following lines, replacing "YOURFILEPATHHERE" with a file path where these files will be saved:

```{r eval = FALSE}

install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
usethis::use_course(
    "https://github.com/mfiorina/sais_r_course/archive/main.zip",
    destdir = "YOURFILEPATHHERE"
)

```

## Instructor Biography

My name is Marc-Andrea Fiorina, and I am a research analyst at OpenResearch. Over the past six years, I worked as an intern, research assistant, and analyst using R for impact evaluations and economic research programs with Development Impact (DIME) at the World Bank. I hold a Bachelor of Arts (Hons.) in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford (2017) and a Master of Arts in International Politics and Economics (Bologna 2018, DC 2019) from Johns Hopkins University SAIS.

As a research assistant, I learnt how to work with data in a collaborative space and how to improve my coding language learning through continuous use and good practices. I hope to share those practices and resources with you through this course.
