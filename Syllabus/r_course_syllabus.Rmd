## Course Description

Entry-level research positions in universities, government offices, think tanks, and multilateral institutions are increasingly expected to perform basic quantitative tasks using statistical software such as Stata, R, or Python. As data work has become near-ubiquitous in the policy world, so have basic tasks like aggregating, analyzing, summarizing, and visualizing data.

This course approaches the use of a statistical software -- R -- from the perspective of a research assistant. It will introduce you to the methods needed for quantitative work in such a position. This course will also aim to provide you with the resources to continue developing your knowledge and experience of R beyond its duration.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be introduced to the use of:

- `dplyr`'s `select()` and `mutate()` functions to explore and modify datasets;
- `dplyr`'s `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions to generate summary statistics;
- `tidyr`'s `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions to reshape data for easier analysis;
- The `gt` and `stargazer` packages to generate HTML, PNG, or LateX summary tables;
- The `ggplot2` package to generate descriptive scatter plots of data

Students will also be taught how to clean raw data by:

- Identifying duplicates
- Finding outliers
- Looking for data inconsistencies
- Codifying missing values
- Encoding categorical character variables

## Course Requirements

As there will be no time for this in class, **YOU NEED TO DO THE FOLLOWING BEFORE THE FIRST SESSION:**

- Download R at this link: https://cran.r-project.org/
  - Windows users, click on 'Download R for Windows' and then download the 'base' version. The file should be called `R-4.1.3-win.exe`.
  - Mac users, click on 'Download R for MacOS' and then download the file called `R-4.1.3.pkg`.
  
- Download RStudio at this link: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. Download the 'RStudio Desktop: Open Source Edition' version.

<br><br>

Note -- Readings and resources below are optional and are provided for context and use after the course is finished. The session slides will cover everything needed for the course.

<br>

### Session 1 -- Learning R through the Tidyverse

- For those who are fully new to R, I strongly recommend: Thomas Mock, "A Gentle Introduction to Tidy Statistics in R" -- [blog post](https://themockup.blog/posts/2018-12-10-a-gentle-guide-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/) and [video](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/). We won't have much time to review the basics of R programming during the first session.

## Instructor Biography

My name is Marc-Andrea Fiorina (MA -- SAIS Bologna 2018, DC 2019), and I am a research analyst with the Development Impact Evaluation unit (DIME) at the World Bank. Prior to studying at SAIS, I received my BA (Hons) in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford.

I started at DIME as an intern in the Spring 2019 Semester and worked as a research assistant there from October 2019 to August 2021. I now work on a project that analyzes the gendered impacts of providing cash-for-work programs to women in low- and middle-income countries.

As a research assistant, I learnt how to work with data in a collaborative space and how to improve my coding language learning through continuous use and good practices. I hope to share those practices and resources with you through this course.
