## Data Visualization — Descriptive Statistics — Plots

---

## Descriptive Stats Plots

`ggplot2` is the gold standard in data visualization in data work. It's one of the main reason that people use R over other programming languages.

Very simple syntax and allows you to add elements very easily.

You can use `ggplot2` to create any type of plot you can think of.

I've included a lot of links at the end of these slides to explore the possibilities of `ggplot2` further. Strongly recommend you use them or at least save them somewhere.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}

knitr::include_graphics(
    "pics/plot_example2.png"
)
```

---

### The Magic of `ggplot2`

Using `ggplot2` to create plots is great because the **structure** it sets up makes plot creation intuitive.

.pull-left-wide[
``` {r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>,
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <SCALE_FUNTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION> +
  <THEME_FUNCTION>
```
]

.pull-right-wide[
1. `Data`: The data that you want to visualize
2. `Layers`: geom\_ and stat\_ → The geometric shapes and statistical summaries representing the data
3. `Aesthetics`: aes() → Aesthetic mappings of the geometric and statistical objects
4. `Scales`: scale_ → Maps between the data and the aesthetic dimensions
5. `Facets`: facet_ → The arrangement of the data into a grid of plots
6. `Visual themes`: theme() and theme_ → The overall visual defaults of a plot

### Bar Plot — Step-by-Step

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Dataset]

Start with a dataset you want to visualize

```{r}
mtcars_summary <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(
    mpg = mean(mpg)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

mtcars_summary
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Convert to Plot]

.pull-left-wide[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars_summary)

```

]

.pull-right-wide[

```{r, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars_summary)

```

]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Add Something]

.pull-left-wide[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars_summary) +
  geom_col(
    aes(
      x = cyl,
      y = mpg
    )
  )
```

]

.pull-right-wide[

```{r, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars_summary) +
  geom_col(
    aes(
      x = cyl,
      y = mpg
    )
  )
```

]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Fix Class Issue]

.pull-left-wide[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars_summary) +
  geom_col(
    aes(
      x = factor(cyl),
      y = mpg
    )
  )
```

`cyl` categorizes cars by number of cylinders. Although the values are numbers, it is a **categorical** variable. We communicate this to `ggplot()` using the `factor()` function.

## Plot Standards

.content-box-blue[
1. Your plot should be <font color = "red">**properly labeled**</font>:
    - The plot should have a title describing its content
    - Axes should be labeled
    - Legend (if any) should have a title and labels
    
2. Your plot should be <font color = "red">**properly formatted**</font>:
    - Axis dimensions should be appropriate. What is appropriate varies depending on context, but usually you should aim to fill the plot space with data
    - Text size should be large enough for text to be legible
    
3. Your plot should be <font color = "red">**self contained**</font>. People should be able to understand your plot and its data without any other context or explanatory text. That means:
    - A caption note that includes data source and any important data construction notes
    - Title and subtitle that deliver the plot's *message*

## Data Visualization — Descriptive Statistics — Tables

---

## Descriptive Statistics Tables

Thankfully, not every RA position requires academic-standard tables or use of LateX.

It is still useful, however, to be able to communicate descriptive statistics about data.

There are countless R packages to help do this. Today, we're looking at the `gt` package. It's simple to use and it's very easy to create good-looking tables using it.

`gt` exports into .png, .pdf, or .html. You can add interactive elements, plots within columns.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}

knitr::include_graphics(
  
    "pics/gt_table_example.png"
  
)
```

---

### Descriptive Statistics Table — Step-by-Step

We will mainly use the example in the script for this. To summarize, the steps are:

- Create a dataset you want to export

- Run the dataset through the `gt()` function to create a gt object

- Customize the table using functions from the `gt` package (see online for further things you can do). Examples of what you can do include:
    - Modify column names — `cols_label()`
    - Modify borders — `tab_style()`, `cell_borders()`
    - Add colors conditional on cell value — `data_color()`
    - Add title/subtitle — `tab_header()`

- Export the table using `gtsave()`

## Data Visualization — Simple Regression Table

---

### Regression Tables

Regression tables are very common in economic/policy analysis.

They're very simple to create using R and a software called **LateX** (pronounced latek).

Unless you're getting into academic research, you don't need to know how to properly use LateX. Just enough to:

- Export the LateX script from R
- Copy/paste it into a LateX-reading software, e.g. Overleaf
- Export the pdf or png to share

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
magick::image_read_pdf("pics/reg_table_example.pdf",
                       pages = 1)
```

---

### Regression Table — Step by Step

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Run Regression in R]

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Simplest regression format in R

reg_example <- lm(
    outcome_variable ~ independent_variable + control_variables,
    data = dataset
)

# Observe results

reg_example %>% summary()

```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Convert to Exportable Table]

Simply do one of these!

```{r eval = FALSE}

reg_example_ht <- reg_example %>%
    huxtable::huxreg()

```

OR

```{r eval = FALSE}

reg_example_sg <- reg_example %>%
    stargazer::stargazer() # Many options to make prettier

```

]

]

---

### Regression Table — Step by Step

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Export Huxtable Table]

Some simple options for the Huxtable table:

```{r eval = FALSE}
  
  huxtable::quick_latex(
      reg_example_ht,
      file = "filepath/filepath/filepath/reg_example_ht.tex"
  )
  
  huxtable::quick_pdf
      reg_example_ht,
      file = "filepath/filepath/filepath/reg_example_ht.pdf"
  )
  
  huxtable::quick_html(
      reg_example_ht,
      file = "filepath/filepath/filepath/reg_example_ht.html"
  )
  
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Export Stargazer Table]

```{r eval = FALSE}

# You can export a LateX script using the 'writeLines' function

writeLines(
    reg_example_sg,
    "filepath/filepath/filepath/reg_example_sg.tex"
)

```

To visualize your table, the easiest solution is to:

- Create a free Overleaf account on [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com)
- Open a new document
- Copy/paste your .tex output in between the `begin{document}` and `end{document}` lines
- Click compile and then save!

You can also install the `tinytex` package and use `pdftolatex` to save a PDF file.

### Today's practical component

1. Successfully run the code in the `session_2.R` script

2. Attempt the challenges at the bottom of the script!

---

### Mid-Course Assignment (**Due on Thursday, September 26**)

<ol>
<li> Find an open-source dataset. Anything will do, there is ton of data out there. If you are looking for inspiration, you can explore the <a href = https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday>Tidy Tuesday Github repository</a>. <br></br></li>
<li> Create a new folder called "<b><span style = "color:red">your name</span></b> R Course Assignment". Replace <b><span style = "color:red">your name</span></b> with your name. <br></br></li>
<li> Set up that folder for data use:
    - Create empty "code", "data", and "output" folders within it
    - Create an R Project in that folder. Refer back to last week's slides if you're not sure on how to do this. <br></br></li>
<li> Add your open-source dataset (I strongly recommend downloading or converting it to CSV format) to the "data" folder. <br></br></li>
<li> Download the "r_template.R" script from the "Course Resources" module on Canvas and place it in the "code" folder. <br></br></li>
<li> Write a script that produces and saves a plot using your open-source dataset. </li>
</ol>

---

### Grading criteria

You will submit a .zip file of the "<b><span style = "color:red">your name</span></b> R Course Assignment" folder.

.content-box-blue[
- Setup
    - The script's purpose should be stated at the top of the script
    - The script should load required packages for it to run
    - The script should successfully import the data used for the data visualization
    
- Plot
    - The plot should convey an interesting relationship between variables. For instance, you could use a scatter plot to show how two variables are positively or negatively correlated. Or you could use a bar plot to show the evolution of a variable over time.
    - The plot should meet the "plot standards" laid out in [slide 11](#plot-standards).
    - The script should end with the plot being saved in the "output" folder.
]
    
To receive top grades, the script must fully run in one click without any errors.
